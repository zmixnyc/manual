# Bugs and Features

## Bug reports for Rack

If you encounter a bug in VCV Rack (not a plugin), such as a UI issue, broken functionality, hang, or crash, follow these steps.

- Log in or register for a free [GitHub account](https://github.com/).
- Search [Rack's issue tracker](https://github.com/VCVRack/Rack/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Areactions-%2B1-desc) to check if someone else has posted a similar bug report.
	- If the bug is already reported, vote for it by adding a "thumb-up" reaction on the first post.
	- If not, [open a bug report issue](https://github.com/VCVRack/Rack/issues/new?template=bug_report.md) and fill out the issue template.
	If the template is not filled out, your issue will be closed.

A developer then attempts to reproduce and identify your bug.
If successful, a fix is implemented, publicly tested with development builds, and released in a future Rack version.
